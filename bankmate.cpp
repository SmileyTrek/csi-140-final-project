   *  Purpose:  print a list of strings to stdout, with each element in the vector given as their own line-seperated list item,
   *            with the first list item number equal to argument start, for adding to an already-made list of text
   *      Pre:  1. a vector array containing the string list items to be printed
   *            2. the first list item number
   *     Post:  N/A

   *  Purpose:  fills the 2 vector array reference arguments (will always pass the arrays) with data from tellers.dat, so we only have to read from that file once
